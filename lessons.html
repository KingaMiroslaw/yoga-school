          <h3>Gentle hatha yoga</h3>
          <p>
            The lessons are intended for beginners and anyone who wants to gain
            a solid foundation for practicing yoga. During the 60-minute class,
            we learn postures and slow movements, focusing on three elements:
            asana (correct posture and positioning), pranayama (work with the
            breath), guided meditation that stimulates the mind-body
            relationship.
          </p>

          <h3>Yoga vinyasa</h3>
          <p>
            The lessons are intended for intermediate to advanced learners, but
            beginners are also welcome. In a 60-minute class that focuses on
            breathing-synchronized movements, you will inhale and exhale as you
            change yoga poses vigorously.

          <h3>Regenerative yoga</h3>
          <p>
            During 90-minute classes, we learn very slow movements and long-term
            positions with leaning against a chair or a wall. These quiet,
            regenerative exercises are suitable for people of all skill levels.
            They can also be an excellent form of post-traumatic rehabilitation.

        <h2>Relax in the savasana position</h2>
        <p>
          Prepare to enter the state of savasana. Lie down on the mat, place
          your arms alongside your body, with your palms facing upwards. Close
          your eyes, breathe slowly but deeply. Melt into the mat and let your
          worries float away. When you are done relaxing, roll slowly to your
          side and, with your arms, move to the cross-legged sitting position.
          Put your hands together as for prayer. Make yourself happy with what
          you have. Namaste.
