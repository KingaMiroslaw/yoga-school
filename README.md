# About The App

The project was created while learning the basics of HTML, CSS and Responsive Web Design from the book "Basics of Web Design HTML5 & CSS" (5th Edition) by Terry Felke-Morris.

This is a very simple 'Path of Light' yoga school website that represents the school and provides basic information for both existing and new students. 
The site consists of a home page, a page that lists the types of yoga lessons offered, a schedule page, and a contact page.

Features:
- Send contact form
- Listen to a relaxing recording
- Show information about the school and about the types of lessons
- Display information about schedule
